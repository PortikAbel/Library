                <h2>Sport</h2>

                <!--keretezett paragrafus-->
                <p class="bordered">Touring motorcycles are specifically designed to excel at covering long distances. They have large-displacement engines, fairings and screens that offer good weather and wind protection, large-capacity fuel tanks for long ranges between fill-ups, and a relaxed, upright seating position.</p>

            <h1>Scooters and mopeds</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Scooters</h2>
                <p> Scooter engine sizes range smaller than motorcycles, 50–850 cc, and have all-enclosing bodywork that makes them cleaner and quieter than motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Mopeds</h2>
                <p>The moped used to be a hybrid of the bicycle and the motorcycle, equipped with a small engine (usually a small two-stroke engine up to 50 cc, but occasionally an electric motor) and a bicycle drivetrain, and motive power can be supplied by the engine, the rider, or both. </p>
