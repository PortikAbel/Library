            <h1>Full-dress tourers</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>General descriptions</h2>
                <p>Full-dress touring motorcycles are generally characterized by extremely large fairings and ample bodywork compared to other types of tourers. Hard luggage, e.g. panniers and a top box, are integrated into the design of the motorcycle which usually has a very large displacement, torquey engine with a very upright, comfortable riding position.</p>
                <p>Additionally, optional amenities for full-dress tourers might include equipment not normally offered on other motorcycles such as complete stereos (AM/FM radios with CD players or MP3 connections), satellite radio, heated seats and hand-grips, GPS navigation systems, custom windshields, integrated air compressors, and air bags. Beyond what manufacturers supply, 'full dressers' are often customized by owners with additional accessories.</p>

            <h1>Adventure tourers</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>A recent type, the adventure touring motorcycle is a dual-sport motorcycle that allows long-range touring both on-road and off-road capabilities. Adventure tourers have high ground clearance (for off-road purposes), large fuel capacity, under-stressed engines for high reliability.</p>
                <p>Modified adventure tourers are sometimes used in gruelling rally events, such as the Dakar Rally.</p>
                <h2>Equipment</h2>
                <p>They may have rugged GPS navigation systems, wire-spoked wheels with road-legal knobby tyres, skid plates (to protect the engine and transmission during off-road use), and tough metal panniers.</p>
