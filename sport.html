            <h1>Design elements</h1>
                <h2>Braking systems</h2>
                <p>They combine higher performance brake pads and disc brakes with multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors.</p>
                <h2>Suspension</h2>
                <p>Suspension systems are advanced in terms of adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability.</p>
                <h2>Tires</h2>
                <p>Front and rear tires are larger and wider than tires found on other types of motorcycles to allow higher cornering speeds and greater lean angles.</p>
                <h2>Fairings</h2>
                <p>Fairings may or may not be used on a sport bike; when used, fairings are shaped to reduce aerodynamic drag as much as possible and provide wind protection for the rider.</p>

            <h1>Classes</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Lightweight</h2>
                        <p>Also called entry level, small or beginner bikes. Some two strokes in this class have dramatically higher performance than the four strokes, being likened to miniature superbikes. Sport bikes with engine displacements of up to about 500 cc are usually in this class.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Midweight</h2>
                        <p>Mid-sized, mid-level, or supersport. Displacements of 600–750 cc are typical.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h2>Superbikes</h2>
                        <p>Liter-class, or literbike, i.e. 1,000 cc. As with supersport, many of the models in this class compete in superbike racing. </p>
